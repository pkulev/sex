* The Sex language
Sex is a S-expressions language, which transpiles to C.

Sex is also Chicken, since all source processing and compile-time
computations are written in Chicken.

And Chicken is [[https://call-cc.org][R5RS Scheme]].

* Compilation
First, get yourself a Chicken. Second, some Chicken deps.

** Install Chicken Eggs
By the way, there's a way to make Chicken install eggs non-globally. Refer to
the documentation for more info:
https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extension%20tools#changing-the-repository-location

~chicken-install fmt getopt-long brev-separate test tree srfi-1 srfi-13~

** Compilation
~make~

* Usage
** Summary
#+begin_src
Usage: sexc [options] filename [-- options-for-c-compiler]
Options:
 --c-compiler=ARG         Select C compiler. Defaults to value of SEX_CC
                          environment variable, or if it is empty, to cc
 -c, --compile-object     Compile object file instead of executable program
 -E, --preprocess         Emit C code
 --public-interface       Get module's public interface
 -h, --help               Show this help
 -m, --macro-expand       Emit macro-expanded Sex code
 -o, --output=ARG         Write output to file. Default file name is a.out.
                          If -E or -m options are provided, defaults to stdout
#+end_src
** Compiling Hello World
#+begin_src
sexc ./examples/hell-world.sex -o hello
#+end_src

That's it. Now you should have executable named ~hello~ in your
directory. Sex uses C under the hood, the default C compiler is ~cc~,
but you can pass any using ~--c-compiler~ option, or by setting
~SEX_CC~ environment variable.

** Example
An example of Sex source:
#+begin_src
(include stdio.h)

(pub fn int main ((int argc) (char **argv))
  (puts "Hello from Sex!")
  (var (array char 512) name)
  (puts "What is your name?")
  (scanf "%s" (cast char* &name))
  (printf "Hello, %s!\n" name)
  0)
#+end_src

Compile and run:
#+begin_src
~/dev/sex $ ./sexc ./example/hello-world.sex -o hello-world
~/dev/sex $ ./hello-world
Hello from Sex!
What is your name?
Alex
Hello, Alex!
#+end_src

* Features
** Full C interoperability
Just ~(include "Your/Favourite/Library.h")~ and use it as you would
have is C.

** Auto unkebabification
For hardcore fans of traditional Lisp naming convention,
Sex offers automatic unkebabification of all symbols, i.e. no more
ugly ~GL_ARRAY_BUFFER~ s in your code, they may be written in their
proper form: ~GL-ARRAY-BUFFER~.

** Modules
Each source file is a module. Module can provide public interface and
be imported by using ~(import path/to/module)~ expression. Module
search path consists of two parts: first is relative to the source
being compiled location, and the second is ~SEX_MODULE_PATH~
environment variable.

Module's public interface consists of everything declared
~pub~. Structures, function, macros, types, variables can be
public.

** Syntactic macros
Sex has support for syntactic macros. Macro definitions look like
functions: they have a name, an argument list and a body. Macro should
return Sex code.

*** Examples:
**** Structure with templated value type
#+begin_src
(pub defmacro (list-T type)
  (let ((list-type (cat 'list- type)))
    `(struct ,list-type
       ((,type value)
        ((* ,list-type) next)))))

(list-T int)
#+end_src
->
#+begin_src
(struct list_int
 ((int value)
  ((* list_int) next)))
#+end_src

**** Wrapper for checking return codes
#+begin_src
(pub defmacro (check-sdl-return call message ret-code)
  `((if (< 0 ,call)
        (begin
         (puts ,message)
         (return ,ret-code)))))

(pub fn int init ()
  (check-sdl-return
    (SDL-Init SDL-INIT-VIDEO) "Failed to initialize SDL" 1)
...)
#+end_src
->
#+begin_src
(%fun int init ()
  (if (< 0 (SDL_Init SDL_INIT_VIDEO))
    (%begin (puts "Failed to initialize SDL") (return 1)))
  ...)
}
#+end_src

** Use an established environment for development
As Sex is S-expressions, you always have Emacs with paredit as your
best option.

*** sex-mode.el
To harness the power of sex-mode, add the following lines to your
~$HOME/.config/emacs/init.el~:
#+begin_src
(use-package sex-mode
  :load-path "/path/to/sex"
  :mode ("\\.sex\\'"))
#+end_src
